// Snes9x PS5: a crash printer and stage markers, so a fault names where it happened (ProsperoCrash.cpp).

// 1.6 reached the shelf on the console and then died with "PPSA99009 crashed before KStuff was paused",
// with no line after "[covers] ... to download" in boot.log: an unhandled fault, and nothing said where.
// This installs signal handlers (SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/SIGILL/SIGFPE/SIGABRT/SIGTRAP) on a separate signal stack
// (so a stack overflow can still be reported), modelled on PS5SX2's orbis-shims/ProsperoCrash.cpp. On a
// fault it writes one block to boot.log: the signal, the fault address, rip, the current stage of each
// thread group, and a short list of return addresses, each as an offset from an anchor symbol so the
// address maps straight into build/app/snes9x-pie.elf with llvm-addr2line.
